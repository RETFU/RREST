# RREST

**RREST** helps to build a REST API in PHP.

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/RETFU/RREST.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RETFU/RREST)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/RETFU/RREST/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/RETFU/RREST?branch=master)
![WIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/unstable-master-red.svg)
![PHP7 supported](http://php7ready.timesplinter.ch/RETFU/RREST/badge.svg)

## Versions
> Important: **RREST 2.0** is in active development. It doesn't cover RAML 1.0 completely.

### RAML 1.0
RAML 1.0 is not covered completely.

Known missing feature:
- Support date format that are not `datetime`.

Limitations of RAML handling can be found in its [Parameter handling](https://github.com/RETFU/RREST/blob/master/src/Parameter.php).

### RAML 0.8
For usage with RAML 0.8 please use RREST v1.x versions.


**RREST** binds an [API specification language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_RESTful_API_Description_Languages) (APISpec) and a Router. It also provides convention to follow best practice.

## Installation

> **RREST** is in active development and not available in [packagist](https://packagist.org) for the moment.

Manually update your composer.json file:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "https://github.com/RETFU/RREST"
    }
],
"require": {
    "retfu/rrest": "dev-master"
}
```

Then:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Usage

```php
<?php
use RREST\Router;
use RREST\APISpec;

$ramlFile = 'api.raml';

$app = new Silex\Application();

//more application logic here if needed

$apiDefinition = (new Raml\Parser())->parse($ramlFile, true);
$apiSpec = new APISpec\RAML($apiDefinition);
$router = new Router\Silex($app);

//bind RAML + Silex
$rrest = new RREST\RREST($apiSpec, $router, 'Controllers');
//if you don't want to validate your response again the APISpec schema, set to false
//useful in production to have better performance on large response, like list of object
$rrest->setAsserResponse(false);
$route = $rrest->addRoute();

//more application logic here if needed

$app->run();

?>
```

## Features

### Validation

Based on the APISpec description, **RREST** validate i/o:
* headers
* query parameters
* protocol
* request payload against a schema define in the spec
* response payload against a schema define in the spec


#### Headers

`Accept` is required for every request.  
`Content-Type` is required for `POST` & `PUT` method.

> **RREST** supports JSON & XML for input/output and partially supports CSV for
> output, so valid mime-types are: `application/json`, `application/x-json`,
> `text/xml`, `application/xml`, `application/x-xml`, 'text/csv' and
> 'application/csv'.

#### Protocol

If you define your API endpoint as https only, **RREST** will validate that.

#### Request payload

Depending of the `Content-Type` header, **RREST** will validate:
* if the format (`JSON`or `XML`) is valid
* if it follow the schema (`JSON Schema` or `XML Schema`)

The schema is required by **RREST**, you must define it in your APISPec.  
This will ensure that data input is valid.


#### Response payload

Depending of the `Accept` header, **RREST** will validate:
* if the format (`JSON`or `XML`) is valid
* if it follow the schema (`JSON Schema` or `XML Schema`)
* there's no validation for `CSV`

A schema is not required by **RREST** for a response. But this is a security to be sure that your response
respect your APISpec and your documentation based on it.

### Cast

If query parameters & request body payload are valid, **RREST** will convert to the type define in the APISPec.  
At the end in the controller, you will have true json, xml for payload & integer, boolean... for query parameters.

### Automatic binding route

**RREST** binds the route to a controller by following this convention:
* `POST /item/` -> `Controllers\Item#postAction`
* `GET /item/{itemId}/` -> `Controllers\Item#getAction`
* `GET /item/{itemId}/comment` -> `Controllers\Item\Comment#getAction`
* `PUT /item/{itemId}/comment/{commentId}` -> `Controllers\Item\Comment#putAction`

> Note: You can define the controller namespace (here Controllers) in the RREST\RREST constructor

#### Ordering route

The order of API definitions matters. RREST will match the first definition that corresponds to the route called.

To use plain route as well as route with parameters with the same base, precedence should be as follow :
```raml
# First, endpoints with params, then plain endpoints.
/item/{itemId}
/item/archive
```

> If done in the other way, calling `GET /item/archive` would be matched to `/item/{itemId}`, with value "archive" for {itemId}.  
> To prevent this, simply order endpoint definitions.

###  Response

 A `RREST\Response` is injected into the controller with pre-filled values based on the APISpec or errors/exceptions that occur during the handling of a request.

You only need to fill response data to this object because the rest is configured:
* status code: 200 , 201 for `POST`, 40x ...
* header `Content-Type` when the response have a payload body
* the data will be serialized by **RREST** based on the `Content-Type` (you can provided serialized data too and disable the auto-serialization)

If you are in a `POST` request, you can set the location of the newly resource.

```php
<?php
//Use Silex for Router

namespaces Controllers

use Silex\Application;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use RREST\Response;

class Resource
{
    //note the $response is a RREST\Response
    public function postAction(Application $app, Request $request, Response $response)
    {
        $data = ''; // coming from your business logic

        $response->setContent($data); // set the data
        $response->setLocation($url); // in a POST request, you can define the location of the newly resource

        return $response->getRouterResponse(); //return the Router response configured
    }

    public function getAction(Application $app, Request $request, Response $response, $resourceId)
    {
        $data = json_encode(''); // coming from your business logic

        $response->setContent($data); // set the data

        return $response->getRouterResponse(false); //disable the auto-serialization
    }
}

?>
```

## Support

##### Format input/output
* JSON
* XML
* CSV (output only)

##### APISPec
* RAML
* More coming soon

##### Router
* Silex
* More coming soon

## Contributing

Code following PSR2 convention. A git hook is launching before every commit to fix most of the PSR2 typo/error.

Launch unit test:
```bash
./vendor/bin/atoum
```

## Why RREST

All those projects make an **amazing work**:
* [Microrest](https://github.com/marmelab/microrest.php)
* [The API Platform framework](https://github.com/api-platform/api-platform)
* [PSX Framework](https://github.com/k42b3/psx)

But they are frameworks. And all the magics come with dependencies like ORM, other frameworks, response format...

I want:
* to write a REST API with a specification language like RAML, Swagger...
    * to keep my documentation up to date
    * to apply functional testing against
    * to provide a strong spec to write a client
* to plug it to the router/framework of my choice
* to manage all the business logics by my own
* to manage all the persistence layers by my own
